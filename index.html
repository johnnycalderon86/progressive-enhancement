    <h2>The story</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around
            to commiserate. They said, <q class="farmer">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                unfortunate.The
                farmer said, Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
            evening
            everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You
                now
                have eight
                horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></b> </p>
    <hr>
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded,
        <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the
        conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
        broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he
        said,
        <q class='farmer'><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
    <hr>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for
        monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's
        not make a big deal out of it...</p>
