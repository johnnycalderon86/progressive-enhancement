    <h2>The story</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.The
            farmer said, Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
        evening
        everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
            horses!</q>
        The farmer again said, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q> </p>
    <hr>
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded,
        <q><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the
        conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
        broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,
        <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
    <hr>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's
        not make a big deal out of it...</p>
